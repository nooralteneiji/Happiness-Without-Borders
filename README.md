# Research Questions 
**Temporal Trends in Happiness and Migration:**
Let us set the stage by providing a broad understanding of how migration patterns and happiness scores have shifted over time. Recognizing the trends at a macro level can form the foundation for more detailed inquiries.
   - How have migration patterns changed over time in relation to shifts in the happiness scores of both source and destination countries? Factor in global events like economic downturns, conflicts, and major policy shifts.
    
**Migration Effects on Host Country Happiness:**
Once we understand the overarching patterns, it's logical to then focus on the specific implications of these patterns, such as how migration impacts the happiness of the receiving nation.
- How does an influx of migrants impact the happiness score of the host country in subsequent years? Adjust for economic impact, unemployment rates, and social integration programs.

**Happiness and Genetic Diversity:**
After exploring the direct impact of migration on happiness, this question delves deeper into understanding if there's any inherent relationship between a country's happiness score and the genetic diversity of its population.
- Is there a correlation between a nation's average happiness score and the genetic diversity of its population? Control for socioeconomic factors and historical events that might have impacted both happiness and genetic diversity.

**Genetics and Migration:**
Building on the knowledge of how happiness relates to genetic diversity, it's a fitting progression to then explore how genetic factors might influence or be influenced by migration patterns.
- Are there discernible patterns in allelic frequencies among countries with higher emigration rates as compared to those with lower rates? Consider adjusting for shared historical migrations or neighboring country influence.
