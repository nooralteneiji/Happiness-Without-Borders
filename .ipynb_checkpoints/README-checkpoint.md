- The paper reports that genetic influences (i.e., heritability) account for 32–40% of the variation in overall happiness (i.e., SWB, LS), and indicate that heritability varies across populations, subgroups, contexts and/or constructs [(Bang and Roysamb, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9781-6)

- The weighted average heritability of well-being in the first review,[3] based on a sample size of 55,974 individuals, was estimated at 36% (95% CI: 34%-38%), while the weighted average heritability for satisfaction with life was 32% (95% CI: 29%-35%) (n = 47,750) [(Bartel et al., 2013)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1222171110) 

- reported the weighted average heritability across 13 independent studies including more than 30,000 twins (aged 12-88) from seven different countries to be 40% (95% CI: 37%-42%)[(Nes and Røysamb, 2015)](https://academic.oup.com/book/8255)

- Nation as Unit of Analysis. Geopolitical boundaries do not necessarily correspond to cultural boundaries.  In order to address potential problems of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Galton’s problem), some researchers have also advocated defining geographical regions according to six world regions (Murdock 1949) or 10 distinct cultural clusters (Gupta & Hanges, 2004).  Here we adopted this approach of conducting more statistically conservative analyses in order to address with the problem of spatial autocorrelation.  Due to the small sample size, we were not able to adjust for spatial autocorrelation in mediation regression statistical analyses [(1)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rspb.2009.1650)



-  Reported happiness scores are subjective and influenced by numerous factors, including current mood, societal expectations, and memory biases. As such, 
    - the direct correlation between irrational behavior and reported happiness might sometimes be a result of these confounding factors.
    
# hypothesis 
happiness is entirely determined by inner factors: our
biological constitution (“fate”). This constitution decides how we deal with stress, whether we have an easygoing personality, what our personal level of anxiety and stress is, etc.
