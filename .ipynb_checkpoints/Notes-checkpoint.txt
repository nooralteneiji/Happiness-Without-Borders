- The paper reports that genetic influences (i.e., heritability) account for 32–40% of the variation in overall happiness (i.e., SWB, LS), and indicate that heritability varies across populations, subgroups, contexts and/or constructs [(Bang and Roysamb, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9781-6)

- The weighted average heritability of well-being in the first review,[3] based on a sample size of 55,974 individuals, was estimated at 36% (95% CI: 34%-38%), while the weighted average heritability for satisfaction with life was 32% (95% CI: 29%-35%) (n = 47,750) [(Bartel et al., 2013)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1222171110) 

- reported the weighted average heritability across 13 independent studies including more than 30,000 twins (aged 12-88) from seven different countries to be 40% (95% CI: 37%-42%)[(Nes and Røysamb, 2015)](https://academic.oup.com/book/8255)

- Nation as Unit of Analysis. Geopolitical boundaries do not necessarily correspond to cultural boundaries.  In order to address potential problems of spatial autocorrelation (e.g., Galton’s problem), some researchers have also advocated defining geographical regions according to six world regions (Murdock 1949) or 10 distinct cultural clusters (Gupta & Hanges, 2004).  Here we adopted this approach of conducting more statistically conservative analyses in order to address with the problem of spatial autocorrelation.  Due to the small sample size, we were not able to adjust for spatial autocorrelation in mediation regression statistical analyses [(1)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rspb.2009.1650)



-  Reported happiness scores are subjective and influenced by numerous factors, including current mood, societal expectations, and memory biases. As such, 
    - the direct correlation between irrational behavior and reported happiness might sometimes be a result of these confounding factors.
    
# hypothesis 
happiness is entirely determined by inner factors: our
biological constitution (“fate”). This constitution decides how we deal with stress, whether we have an easygoing personality, what our personal level of anxiety and stress is, etc.

Clear Hypothesis and Objective: 
Start with a clear hypothesis on how you believe migration and 5-HTTLPR allele frequencies might interact and influence the outcome (happiness). 

Control Variables: 
Include control variables that might influence happiness but are outside the scope of your primary predictors (e.g., economic indicators, political stability).

Interaction Terms: 
In your regression models, include interaction terms between migration patterns and allele frequencies. This will allow you to examine if the effect of one predictor on happiness varies depending on the level of the other predictor.

Propensity Score Matching: 
If you have reason to believe there's a selection bias in migration (certain types of individuals are more likely to migrate), use propensity score matching to balance your dataset based on observed characteristics.

Mixed-Methods Analysis: 
Pair your quantitative analyses with qualitative insights, perhaps by studying the historical context of migrations for certain countries or ethnographic insights on happiness and community structures in areas with notable migration.

Feedback Loop Consideration: 
Remember that while migration might influence happiness via genetic dispersion, happiness levels in a country (or lack thereof) might also influence migration. It's a potential feedback loop that should be acknowledged.

Multiple Analyses: 
Don't rely solely on a single analysis or model. By examining the data from multiple angles and through various techniques, you can gain a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the relationships at play.
